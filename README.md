# Privacy Policy for Mindful Moment App

**Last Updated:** May 23, 2025

Thank you for using Mindful Moment ("App"), an application provided by an individual developer. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled by the App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

Mindful Moment is designed with your privacy at its core. The App **does not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.** All data you enter into the App, including mood entries, journal notes, and settings, is stored locally on your device.

### Data You Provide

* **Mood Entries:** Information about your mood, selected guidance text, and any journal notes you choose to write. This data is stored locally on your device and is used to provide you with features such as mood history, insights, and streaks.
* **Settings and Preferences:** Information related to your app preferences, such as reminder settings. This data is also stored locally on your device.

### Automatically Collected Information (Locally)

* **Usage Data:** The App may collect data about your interaction with the App, such as feature usage, streaks, and milestone achievements. This information is stored locally on your device and is used to personalize your experience and provide features like streaks and milestones.

## Data Storage

All data generated by your use of the Mindful Moment App is stored exclusively on your mobile device within the App's private storage. This means:

* We, the developer, do not have access to your personal data.
* Your data is not uploaded to any cloud servers or third-party services by the App.
* If you uninstall the App, the locally stored data may be deleted from your device, depending on your operating system's behavior.

## Data Sharing

Since all data is stored locally on your device and not collected by the developer, your personal data is **not shared** with any third parties by the App.

## Children's Privacy

Mindful Moment is intended for individuals aged 13 and older. The App does not knowingly collect any personal information. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data (which should not be possible as the app stores data locally), please contact us.

## Third-Party Services

The Mindful Moment app utilizes certain third-party libraries and services to provide its functionality. These include:

* **Expo:** The application is built using the Expo framework. Expo may collect anonymized usage statistics and error reporting data as per their own privacy policies.
* **React Native and associated libraries:** Core framework and libraries for building the application.
* **AsyncStorage:** Used for local data storage on your device.
* **Expo Haptics, Expo Font, Expo Linking, etc.:** Various Expo modules used for device features. These modules operate locally on your device.

These services operate under their own privacy policies. However, as stated, Mindful Moment itself does not transmit your personal mood and journal data to these or any other third-party services.

## Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data largely depends on the security of your device itself (e.g., using a passcode, keeping your operating system updated).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on the App's store listing.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
